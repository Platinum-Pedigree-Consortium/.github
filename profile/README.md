# The Platinum Pedigree Consortium

The Platinum Pedigree Consortium (PCC) is a collaborative project to create a comprehensive reference for human genetic variation using a four-generation, 28-member family (CEPH 1463). We employed five different short and long-read sequencing technologies to generate phased assemblies and characterize both inherited and _de novo_ variation, including at some of the most difficult to genotype genomic regions such as tandem repeats, centromeres, and the Y chromosome. This extensive "truth set" is publicly available and can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to better understand human genetic variation.
